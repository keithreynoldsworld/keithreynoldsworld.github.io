CAT CHAT v. 1.1.1 2015

Cat chat is a ruby/javascript chat app connected to a private ruby back end and a public api speech engine.  The most recent message in the current chatroom is sent out as text and received back as an mp3 encased in an array.  The mp3 is then played automatically using HTML5 on the user's computer.  Messages are stored and organized by the ruby program on the back-end.  The two computer languages communicate with each other via JSON -  javascript object notation.  There is a stats board, showing the latest stats, updated every second, and each chat room has a different display window showing that particular chatroom's messages in order from the past five minutes, also updated every second.
